- This project was installed through react-app

- To ensure the project flow I recommend doing npm install to ensure that all dependencies are installed

- After doing npm install, just perform npm start and the project will open at http://localhost:3000

- The API must be working for the project to be able to request the information, if the API is not open or the information takes a long time to arrive, a loader will appear on the main page 

- The entire project was carried out without consultation, only with knowledge acquired throughout my professional experience, so your feedback will be important for me to be able to correct some necessary points.
